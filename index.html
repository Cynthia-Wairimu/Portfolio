    <h3>About me.</h3>  
    <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Nairobi, I was pursuing a bachelor's degree in Geospatial Engineering. I was an intern at the Ministry of lands, kiambu county. During my internship I noticed a big gap in the way things are carried out in the lands department. Alot of process needed to be automated as they were repetitive. I have to acquire coding skills to make that possible, that is my why.</p>
    <p>Here are some of my current interests:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hiking</li>
      <li>Swimming</li>
      <li>Photography</li>
      <li>Coding</li>
    </ul>
