      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of the University of Nairobi, I was pursuing a
        bachelor's degree in Geospatial Engineering. I was an intern at the
        Ministry of lands, kiambu county. During my internship I noticed a big
        gap in the way things are carried out in the lands department. Alot of
        process needed to be automated as they were repetitive. I have to
        acquire coding skills to make that possible, that is my why.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of my current interests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
